The Alternative Dictionary
=========================================

The Altdictionary began as a simple class project for experimenting with web technologies such as AJAX and the HTML5 canvas tag.

What It Do?
------------

The Altdictionary is a database of images. Each image represents a "definition" of something (or some idea, some feeling, some abstraction). Anyone with an account is able to contribute visual definitions, and to vote on the definitions supplied by other visitors. There are no rules regarding these definitions. If you want to call an apple a cookie, you may draw a picture of a cookie and submit it under the name "apple". No one is going to stop you. Language is a human construct and it only works if we come to a consensus on the meaning of words. In this case, there is no consensus. This is a place to create our own language and share our own meanings.
